\chapter{Preface}
This summary was created during the spring semester 2019
``Introduction to Machine Learning'' lecture
by Prof. Dr. Krause at ETH Zurich.
It is based on the material taught during
the lectures and tutorials.

The content should be mostly complete in terms of material.
However, there are still quite a few open points,
usually marked with a TODO in the text.
While most TODOs are placeholders for derivations or examples,
a few places were unclear and thus not very coherent.

In general, the goal of this summary was personal use.
Therefore, there may be a few contentual and many
typographical (and grammatical) errors.
If you encounter substantial issues,
feel free to write to me via \href{mailto:aernim@student.ethz.ch}{aernim@student.ethz.ch}.
However, I take no responsibility for the content of this summary,
decline any liability and do not claim the content to be my own.
May this help you during your studies.
