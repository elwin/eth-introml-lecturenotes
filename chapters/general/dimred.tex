\section{Dimensionality Reduction}
The basic challenge is:
Given a data set
$D = \{\vec{x}_1, \dotsc, \vec{x}_n\} \in \mathbb{R}^d$,
find an \emph{embedding}
$\vec{z}_1, \dotsc, \vec{z}_n \in \mathbb{R}^k$
with $k < d$.

The embedding may then be used for visualisation,
regularisation (model selection),
unsupervised feature discovery,
and more.

Typically, a mapping $f : \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^k$
with $k \ll d$ is obtained.

In \emph{linear dimensionality reduction},
the mapping is of the form
$f(\vec{x}) = \vec{A}\vec{x}, \vec{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times d}$.
In \emph{nonlinear dimensionality reduction},
other mappings (parametric or non-parametric) are used.

Linear dimensionality reduction can be interpreted as a form of
compression.
It should be possible to accurately reconstruct the original data
from the embedding.
