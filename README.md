ETH Introduction to Machine Learning Lecture Notes
==================================================
This summary was created during the spring semester 2019
"Introduction to Machine Learning" lecture
by Prof. Dr. Krause at ETH Zurich.
It is based on the material taught during
the lectures and tutorials.

The most recent build can be found in the file
``IntroML Lecture Notes SS19 AerniMichael.pdf``.
It was built using pdflatex.

The content should be mostly complete in terms of material.
However, there are still quite a few open points,
usually marked with a TODO in the text.
While most TODOs are placeholders for derivations or examples,
a few places were unclear and thus not very coherent.

In general, the goal of this summary was personal use.
Therefore, there may be a few contentual and many
typographical (and grammatical) errors.
If you encounter substantial issues,
feel free to create an issue or pull request on GitHub.
**Please contribute your additions and improvements back to this repository. That way, the lecture notes can grow better over time!**

In general, I take no responsibility for the content of this summary,
decline any liability and do not claim the content to be my own.
May this help you during your studies!
